However, the primary repository for these articles and the Hodgkin's / diseasome analysis is <https://github.com/dhimmel/hodgkins>.
This repository does not appear to contain essential code to reproduce the analysis,
but likely contains development activity prior to the [first commit](https://github.com/dhimmel/hodgkins/commit/6c95f8615bc854294478cfa6ad74604859e0b165) of `dhimmel/hodgkins` from 2015-07-20.
